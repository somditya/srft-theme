<h3>Content Review Policy </h3>
SRFTI Website is the face of Satyajit Ray Film & Television Institute. It is therefore required to keep the content on the Website current and up-to-date and hence there is a need for the Content Review Policy.

</div>

<div role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-8" id="tabpanel-8" tabindex="0"> 
<h3>Content Archival Policy </h3>
Each of the content components is accompanied by meta data, source and validity date. For some of the components the validity date may not be known i.e., the content is stated to be perpetual. Under this scenario, the validity date should be ten years hence. Under no circumstances, any content is to be displayed on the Website after the validity date.  

 For few of the components like announcements, tenders, only the live content 	whose validity date is after the current date is shown on the Website. For other components like documents, schemes, services, forms, websites and contact directory there is a need for timely review of the same as per the Content Review Policy.  

 List of content contributed is sent to the content contributor two weeks prior to the validity date to revalidate the content and if required modify the validity date. In case of no response, then a reminder is sent a week before the validity date and therefore the content is archived and no longer published on the Website.  

 For the retrieval of content which has expired, there is a need to archive the content. Government Websites, Forms, Services and Contact Directory which are discontinued should be expunged.
